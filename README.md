# gba-music-with-timers

Roughly plays the notes C, E, G, then C.

**Note: unless a proper header is added, these programs will not work on real hardware (nor some emulators).**
I do not include the bitmap of the Nintendo logo in the header in order to avoid copyright infringement.
If you want to run these programs on an emulator, I'd recommend [No$gba](https://problemkaputt.de/gba.htm) or [mGBA](https://mgba.io/).

Assemble with the [Goldroad 1.7](https://www.gbadev.org/tools.php?showinfo=192) assembler:
```sh
goldroad.exe music_with_timers.asm
```
